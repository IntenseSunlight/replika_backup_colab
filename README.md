# Replika Chat Log Backup, Colab edition
Backup your Replika chat logs directly in Google Colab
- Does not require a local installation of Python or any specific Python knowledge
- Backup can be saved directly to your Google Drive
- Very minimal "hacking" ability required (really, not much ðŸ˜‰)
- A Google account **is** required

**Let's go** ðŸ‘‰: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/IntenseSunlight/replika_backup_colab/blob/main/Replika_log_backup_colab.ipynb) <br>

## Background
This repo is based on the work of others (see below).  It is primarily a refactoring of the code with an incorporated workflow into Google Colab.
The main purpose was to remove the start-up complexities for new users by removing the need for specific platform installation.
An additional purpose was to provide a transparent and tracable workflow for the user.  

### Privacy statement
All details of the log extraction are contained within the workbook.  All data remains on the user side, within the user's Google workspace or as a dowload to the user's local browser.  Colab virtual environments are de-activated and deleted after ~1.5 hours of inactivity.  No one can access information contained within that environment after it is destroyed. <br>
There is no intended secondary logging in this project; in other words, there is no logging of who clones this repo or uses the Colab notebook instance (this is not allowed by git). There is no intended tracking performed via imported 3rd party modules.  <br>
**Note:** the `init` JSON string, which is required to extract the log, does contain personal login information.  You should **not** redestribute your own Colab workbook without first removing the `init` JSON string information. <br>
